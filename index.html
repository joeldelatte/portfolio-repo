    <p> Hello, my name is Joel Delatte. I am a classically trained musician, a chef and now I am on the path to becoming
        a web developer. New Orleans is my family home. My wife Dawn and I grew up together there and eventually moved to Austin
        in 2010. Since then we've enjoyed life, pursued careers, started new careers and started our family. Our daughter Juliette is 
        a year and a half now and we are having a blast. Some of my goals with development is to create helpful, simple applications that 
        can make life easier in a kitchen.
